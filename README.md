# :arrows_counterclockwise: Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers  :arrows_clockwise:

## Instructions
Add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

Inspect the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

## Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

## User Story
```
  AS AN avid traveller
  I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
  SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```md
  GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
  WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
  THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
```
